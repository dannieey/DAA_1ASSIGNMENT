Project Description

This project implements and analyzes sorting and selection algorithms:

MergeSort — merge sort with insertion sort cutoff for small arrays.

QuickSort — randomized quicksort with recursion optimization.

DeterministicSelect — k-th order statistic selection using median-of-medians.

ClosestPair — finds the closest pair of points in 2D space.

All algorithms include Metrics tracking: comparisons, assignments, recursion depth, memory allocations, and runtime. Results are saved to results/output.csv.

How to Run

The AlgorithmsTest class:

Generates random arrays and points.

Runs all algorithms and collects metrics.

Saves results to results/output.csv.

Prints metrics to console.


Metrics Definitions

Comparisons — number of element comparisons

Assignments — number of element assignments

MaxDepth — maximum recursion depth

Allocations — memory allocations

RunTime — execution time in nanoseconds
